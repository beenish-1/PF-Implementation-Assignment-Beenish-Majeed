## 1. Overview of Implementation, Structure & Running Programs
This repository contains my complete implementation of **30 Programming Fundamentals tasks** using **C++ and Python**.  
To make testing and understanding easier, I have **structured the repository** as follows:
**one main folder** with two subfolders for each language:
 #### Total Files:
- **31 files in C++_Program folder** (30 individual programs + 1 runner)
- **31 files in Python_Program folder** (30 individual programs + 1 runner)

1. ### **Individual Program Files:**  
   - Each program is implemented in a separate, clean, and well-commented file.  
   - Each file contains a **link at the top as a comment**, where you can view the output for that specific program.
     - #### For Python (mention: click the link at the top of the file to run)
     - #### For C++ (mention: click the link at the top of the file to run)

2. ### **All Program Runner Files:**  
   - I have created **one C++ “All_PROGRAM_RUNNER.CPP” file** and **one Python “All_PROGRAM_RUNNER.PY” file**.  
   - These runner files contain all 30 programs in a **menu-based format**.  
   - You simply enter a program number (1–30), and the selected program runs automatically.  
   - Example runner file links:  
     - C++ Runner File Link: `https://www.programiz.com/online-compiler/6puBzbz6BYIwe`
     - Python Runner File Link: `https://www.programiz.com/online-compiler/0KU5MZdTs1rYw`  
   - Output links for these runner files are also included at the top of their source files in comments.

This setup allows anyone reviewing the project to easily see individual program outputs as well as run all programs from one file for convenience.

## 2. List of All 30 Programs
Below is the **format and example** of the list of implemented programs.  
Each program follows the same naming structure:  
`P<number>_<Meaningful_Program_Title>.<extension>`
**Example:**

| #  | Program Title                     | File Name                            |
|----|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1  | Assign and Print Three Variables | P1_Assign_and_Print_Three_Variables.cpp / .py |

> **Note:** All 30 programs follow the same format. For example, Program 2 will be:  
> `P2_Even_or_Odd_Checker.cpp / .py`, Program 3: `P3_Sum_of_Array.cpp / .py`, and so on up to Program 30.  

Additionally, there is **one “All_PROGRAM_RUNNER” file** in each subfolder (C++ and Python) where you can run **all 30 programs in a single menu-based file**.  

- C++ Runner File: `C++_Program/All_PROGRAM_RUNNER.CPP`  
- Python Runner File: `Python_Program/All_PROGRAM_RUNNER.PY`

## 3. Notes
- Each program is in a **separate, clean, commented file**.  
- Every individual program includes an **Output Link in the top comment**.  
- Both C++ and Python implementations are included.  
- All Program Runner files allow easy testing of all programs from one place.
